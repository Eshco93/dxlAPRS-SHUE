# dxlAPRS SondeHub Uploader Extension
This extension for the [dxlAPRS software toolchain](https://github.com/oe5hpm/dxlAPRS) allows uploading of radiosonde telemetry data to the [SondeHub Tracker](https://sondehub.org/).
## Introduction
When operating an amateur radiosonde receiver station, there are a bunch of different software solutions to choose from. Two examples would be [radiosonde_auto_rx](https://github.com/projecthorus/radiosonde_auto_rx) by [Mark Jessop (VK5QI)](https://github.com/darksidelemm) or [dxlAPRS](https://github.com/oe5hpm/dxlAPRS) by Christian Rabler (OE5DXL). There are certainly also a few other solutions and each of them has their own advantages and disadvantages. Telemetry data gathered by amateur radiosonde receiver stations is often uploaded to online databases, on which live radiosonde tracking websites are built. A few examples are [radiosondy.info](https://radiosondy.info/) by Michał Lewiński (SQ6KXY), [SondeHub Tracker](https://sondehub.org/) by [Project Horus](http://www.projecthorus.org/) and [wettersonde.net](https://www.wettersonde.net/) by Jean-Michael Grobel (DO2JMG).
